                    <p>Technology is continuously evolving. We are constantly awaiting the next 'big thing', Apple's new product release, Sony's new video game. We get tech cravings and a desire for more. A constant craving due to the endless releases of new products. This rapid evolution of technology continues to bring unimaginable opportunities. The forever advancing industry has provided the ability to communicate and connect more efficiently, it has increased human intelligence due to the instant access to excessive information, and improved existing job sectors, whilst also forming entirely new ones.</p>
                    
                    <p>As technology evolved we naturally became immersed, it had a profound impact on our day-to-day lives. But consider the things were missing and neglecting as we immerse deeper into the intriguing world of tech. Many of us invest so much into a digital product and suddenly it’s something we can’t put down. 
                        <blockquote>According to Asurion, an electronic device insurer, on average, people check their mobile phone once every 12 minutes, more than 80 times a day, while other studies claim the figure is closer to 150.</blockquote> 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Like many others I find myself checking my phone only to be captivated for hours. Imagine life without digital devices, for many of us, it’s a dreaded perception. How have we got to this point? how have we become so dependent on a product that once never existed? It all links to deep psychology, how the mind works and adapts to these new inventions. Getting you to this point is the aim of every new product release, to trigger the nucleus accumbens widely recognised for its role in the brain's reward circuit, in order to purposely captivate the mind. </p>
                    
                    <p>Whether we are aware or not of this occurrence, products do impact our behaviour. A powerful electronic device now has the ability to modify our behaviour, affect our emotions, impact our work ethic, relationships, and health. You could say these devices hold a dominant position in our lives. <strong>Is this compulsive investment endangering our body and mind and how alarmed should we be?</strong></p>
