                    <p>Digital products invented today have extracted and adopted historic evidence from psychologists and behaviourists and applied it to digital design in order to get users hooked. These tactics have been formed due to the increasing dependency on digital technology. User’s behaviour has been monitored, and a method has cleverly been developed to form potentially addictive products. It’s a method most users are unaware is occurring, an action performed regularly, typical aspects used to describe a habit.</p>
                    
                    <p>Consumer psychology expert, Nir Eyal breaks down this method in his book ‘Hooked’ and explores the formation of habits. The book includes the rhetorical questions, ‘What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit?’ and ‘Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?’ With these questions in mind, Eyal developed the ‘Hook Model’ used to drive user engagement and encourage repetitive actions, without the high costs. Eyal studies behavioural psychology and neuroscience and explored how digital products can target human psychology to build healthy habits. The hook proposes what successful products have in common and consists of four stages:</p>

<div id="trigger" class="content" style="display:none">
    <h3>Trigger</h3>
    <p>The first stage of the hook is the trigger. A trigger is a prompt to capture the user’s attention, intriguing them to embark on their first usage of a product or service. Triggers come in two terms: external and internal. External triggers come in the form of an email, link, or the app icon on your home screen. Eyal describes external triggers as a “call to action” intriguing the user to click. External triggers can then lead to the creation of internal triggers.</p>
    <p>Internal triggers are mostly associated with emotions, generally negative, such as boredom, loneliness, and uncertainty. When experiencing these emotions the internal trigger sets of a memory and users will unconsciously visit the product that once satisfied these emotions. </p>

<div id="action" class="content" style="display:none">
    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>The action phase is simply the actions we carry out when using the product. Eyal defines it as “behaviour done in anticipation of an immediate reward”. The simpler the action the more likely the action will occur. These effortless actions come in the form of scrolling, searching or clicking a button. </p>
    <hr>
</div>

<div id="reward" class="content" style="display:none">
    <h3>Reward</h3>
    <p>From psychology and behavioural evidence it’s clear when the mind associates a reward to an action, it engineers a particular behaviour. Within today’s products rewards may be imagined as badges, points, leaderboards, streaks or unlocking levels, gamified elements hugely beneficial if used to motivate a user to a specific goal. These elements are regularly implemented into various applications relating to health, education, fitness and many more. </p>
    <p>Similar to Skinner’s reinforcement technique products use a method called variable rewards. Skinner believed an effective example of this was slot machines, users had no ability to predict the outcome and it was this unpredictability that drove the repetitive spinning. This phenomenon explains how we become hooked on simple interactions, such as scrolling a news feed to obtain an unexpected post, receiving likes or opening a notification. All are a type of reward, incorporated discreetly to create impulsive cravings.</p>
    <p>I believe the reward stage may be the most important factor of the hook. Some may consider the trigger to be most important as it originates the connect between the user and the product or service. However, although the trigger forms the connection, an element of reward will keep one’s attention and invested time. If the product does not satisfy the emotion that originally prompted us to visit then our interest will discontinue. When we are rewarded with something that removes our boredom, connect with people online to eliminate our loneliness and receive answers to settle our uncertainty, it activates our nucleus accumbens and sparks the feeling of pleasure and achievement. This leaves us longing for more, leading us to the next stage of the hook, investment.</p>
    <hr>
</div>

<div id="investment" class="content" style="display:none">
    <h3>Investment</h3>
    <p>The hook is designed to be a continuous frequent loop. This is achieved through investment. The investment phase will determine if a user will continue to invest time into the product. If a product gathers data or content customised to the user, whether it’s photos, followers, research or streaks, this increases the likelihood of them returning and loads a new cycle of the hook.</p>

                    <p>There are many companies that have mastered habit-forming product design. They have built products with the intent to alter our behaviour. In the words of Nir Eyal, our habits have been “manufactured”. It’s a scary reality.</p>
                    
                    <p>These companies are easily identifiable due to their popularity. In my opinion, the two leading sectors continuously achieving the hook method is gaming and the biggest of all social media. With more and more social media platforms being built, we just add to our mountainous social collection. We fear to relocate to another due to how much we've invested. </p>
                    
                    <p>Each stage of the ‘hook’ no doubt has an impact on the user’s behaviour, but should it really be considered a healthy habit? We have unquestionably developed a habit as digital technology has gradually become a daily life accessory. Businesses strive for this outcome. It’s their priority goal. The value is so significant designers, developers and tech companies would pay $1,700 each for Eyal’s Habit Summit Conference to master manipulation of the mind.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, for a consumer, it’s gradually fostering addictions. Typically, when we think of being hooked or addicted our brain automatically associates it with something negative. The formal definition of ‘addicted’ according to Oxford Dictionaries is to be <strong>‘physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance or activity.’</strong> If we compare recognisable healthy habits that have a beneficial impact on our lives, being hooked on technology doesn’t truly categorise with these habits. I believe if the usage of a device has become an obsession and urge, this behaviour can not be considered healthy. </p>
                    
                    <p>Although various situations suggest Nir Eyal has similar doubts. During the 2017 Habit Summit Eyal addressed the growing concern about these manipulation methods. He touched on technology complaints he calls 'shipwrecks' such as dark patterns, addiction, and distraction. He informed the attendees we need to ensure we follow ethical tracks and prevent persuasion by force or threat. These forceful tactics may include hidden or lengthy unsubscribe processes, coercion checkboxes or inappropriate use of variable rewards.</p>
                    
                    <p>Just as we think he may be second-guessing his own theory. He is defensive of the techniques he teaches and states: <blockquote>“We can’t blame the tech makers for making their products so good we want to use them”.</blockquote></p>
