                    <p>I believe the use of digital technology has become a habit, constant use has formed actions we carry out subconsciously. We’ve naturally embedded it into our lives. For many of us without releasing it's the first action we do as we wake up, look at our device, turn off our alarm, check the news, browse through social media, it has become a natural instinct.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my opinion, we are closed minded, influenced and dependent. We have invested too much and feel like we can’t stop. It has become a need, a part of our lifestyle, a social expectation. Technology is not disappearing, it will continue to advance to things we can currently only imagine. As this fast-paced industry continues to reshape the world around us, I believe we are and will continue to be required to adapt to these changes. Arguably, it’s impossible to keep digital technology absent from our lives. The aim of entirely eliminating usage maps an unrealistic outcome from the beginning.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nir Eyal stated in an interview about his book ‘Hooked’, <strong>“The world is potentially becoming a more addictive place, and technology is becoming more persuasive”</strong>. Perhaps we are becoming subtly addicted to our phones, computer, television or game console. I describe it as a subtle addiction as I believe the term addiction may be used to frequently in today’s society. Some may be obsessed and devoted to a particular product and this behaviour could indeed initiate addictions but in my opinion, the majority only fear the absence of something that’s morphed into their lifestyle.</p>
                    
                    <p>The solution is balance. It’s controlling your usage of technology, rather than technology controlling you. We need to use these opportunities effectively to have a beneficial impact on our lives. The first step is identifying the problem and having the motivation to change. If psychology and reward systems can be used to get us hooked on products the same techniques can be applied to more long-term beneficial outcomes. We can rewire the brain by altering our habits and aim for a more ‘technology-life balance’.</p>
