                    <p>How our behaviour is influenced all begins with one of the largest and most powerful organs, the brain. Human psychology explores the motives of the brain, seeking the deep layers underlying behavioural and cognitive processes. Within these layers and one of the biggest factors for behavioural influences is the nucleus accumbens, located at the lower front of the brain in an area called the basal forebrain, considered to be the pleasure center of the brain. It stores our life encounters for future reference and actively changes every day in response to everything we do.</p>
                    
                    <p>The nucleus accumbens carries an essential neurotransmitter, dopamine. When the reward system circuitry is exposed to pleasurable occurrences, such as food, music, and of course technology dopamine neurons are released. Dopamine serves many purposes from motivation to regular body movements. The drive and focus it provides increases our productivity levels and affects our concentration, energy, mood, and learning. Without it our cognitive abilities which allow us to carry out brain-based skills can deteriorate, therefore we become unmotivated, unsocial, and lack creativity. </p>
                    
                    <p>Many past conducted experiments provide evidence that suggests we can influence behaviour by targeting the brain's reward circuit. In the 1920s many psychologists and behaviourists began to explore possible ways learning and behaviour can be predicted and modified. One of the most influential and noteworthy psychologist was Burrhus Frederic Skinner, commonly recognised as BF Skinner. Skinner approached the idea by evaluating how behaviour and actions were determined by a particular consequence. A phenomenon he labelled as operant conditioning. </p>
                    
                    <p>Although Skinner was regarded as the father of operant conditioning, he wasn't the first psychologist to research learning by consequences. His method operant conditioning extracted and elaborated on the 1898 principle <strong>‘Law of Effect’</strong> advanced by Edward Thorndike, which also studied the effect on behaviour when rewards and punishments were instituted. Thorndike’s learning theory tested on cats involved a puzzle box and required the cat to escape from the box by pressing a lever to be rewarded with food. Once the cat identified the lever and associated it with a rewardable consequence the escaping time decreased greatly. Thorndike believed if an action was encouraged by a reward, the brain would remember this action and the consequence, increasing the likelihood of it being repeated. </p>
                    
                    <p>Skinner approached the topic of behaviour and learning with a similar technique to Thorndike. His main contribution to psychology was his study of behaviour through the use of recording equipment to measure an animal’s responses to particular consequences, now recognised as <strong>‘The Skinner Box’</strong>. The box contained a lever that the rat would press to obtain a reward, food or water. However, where Thorndike waited for the animal to discover the lever accidentally, Skinner attempted to shape the rat’s behaviour by prompting them towards the desired action. He did so by rewarding the animal if they looked at the lever or moved closer to the lever, eventually, the animal would connect the lever to the reward and therefore press the lever. </p>
                    
                    <div class="reinforcement">
                        <p>Skinner originated a third term to his method - <strong>Reinforcement</strong>. Like Thorndike, Skinner tested rewards and punishments, however, reinforcement added the uncertainty of outcomes. He tested four types of reinforcement:</p>

                        <p><b>Positive:</b> the most effective of all, involved added something to encourage a response. </p>

                        <p><b>Negative:</b> removed something negative to encourage a response.</p>

                        <p><b>Punishment:</b> not to be mistaken with negative reinforcement, added something to discourage a response.</p>

                        <p><b>Extinction:</b> the last type of reinforcement, referred to removing something to discourage a response. </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>In 1954, psychologist James Olds and Neuroscientist Peter Milner refined the research and evidence of BF Skinner through experiments that identified the exact area of the brain activated during a reward process. Olds and Milner established the first evidence that suggested the link between the nucleus accumbens and the reward center of the brain, through the use of a Skinner Box and neuromuscular electrical stimulations. The aim was to create a reward sensation from the electrical stimulations, eliminating areas that experienced no response and eventually directly activating and identifying the brain’s reward pathways. </p>
                    
                    <p>As research developed, findings suggested it wasn’t necessary to use electrical stimulations to directly activate the reward circuitry as neuroscience confirmed the nucleus accumbens becomes most active in anticipation of rewards rather than when we successfully achieve the reward. These findings explain why we are so engaged in slot machines, gaming, and excessive scrolling through social media, we strive for something surprising or entertaining to satisfy our impulse for rewardable consequences. </p>
                    
                    <p>Conditioning behaviour through the use of reward, punishment, and reinforcement drives the brain to continue a particular action. The desire to receive the reward progresses to a compulsive urge leading to repetitive actions, which explains how habits are developed. These techniques have been applied to digital products to achieve the same reaction from users as the animals used in Olds, Milner and Skinner’s experiments. I will explore how these phenomena are mapped over to the products we use daily. </p>
