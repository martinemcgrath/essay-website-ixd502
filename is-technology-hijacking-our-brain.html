                    <p>How worried should we really be that tech companies are using psychology to manipulate our minds? I believe for many of us we don’t consider the dangers of tech overuse and are therefore not concerned enough to make changes. With bold alarming headlines, technologists disengaging themselves from their own product, and new features being introduced to combat overuse, does this suggest the issue is having more of a rapid effect than we think? </p>
                    
                    <p>According to ex-Facebook president Sean Parker, significant change is needed after he raised the alarm during an Axios event at the National Constitution Center in 2017. He explained that during the creation of Facebook the aim was to <strong>“exploit human vulnerability”</strong> and later stated, <strong>“God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains”</strong>. </p>
                    
                    <p>During the same year CEO of Netflix Reed Hastings announced their main competitor wasn’t Amazon or YouTube but sleep. He also briefly mentioned with no further information “a new technology capable of helping us recharge without snoozing”. Technology to allow us to engage in more technology. When does it become preposterous? Will it ever stop?</p>
                    
                    <p>Although, it seems tech giants such as Apple and Google may be attempting to reduce overuse as digital well-being becomes a hot topic in the industry. Apple’s new Screen Time app and Google’s Digital Wellbeing feature aim to reduce app overload and mobile usage. The introduction of these features appears to be against their best interests. Why would megabucks companies want you to use their marketed “revolutionary” product less?</p>
                    
                    <p>The true reasoning may be to actually increase their user engagement. As consumers adapt or discontinue behaviour when they identify a negative concern, companies need to react by adopting product fixes, removing or lessening the consumer’s associated negative emotions. In my opinion, the enhancements may be aiming to reduce moral panic, changing the mind of users desiring to execute all usage as it provides a sense of user control and management. Although companies may be moving in the direction to solve device overuse it all relies on the users to put these features to use. </p>
                    
                    <p>Whether technology is having a positive or negative effect is a two-sided topic. Some argue it’s simply moral panic. A typical reference is made to Swiss scientist, Conrad Gessner, when he raised the alarm about the effects of information overload in 1565. He stated it would be “confusing and harmful” and he was referring to books. However, the dangers are mostly associated with the consumer’s usage. Research is conflicting but all agree it’s influencing our behaviour and how we think. For the good or bad really depends on how, when and where we use it. </p>
                    
                    <p>Being heavily reliant on technology can have a serious impact on our body and mind. I previously discussed the benefits and encouragement of regularly releasing dopamine and the huge benefits for our health, so why is there an existing contentious issue about products releasing this neuron each time we engross within it? The problem relates to balance, while a moderate amount of dopamine is crucial, excessive amounts can result in intense competitiveness, aggression, euphoria, and addiction.</p>
                    
                    <p>Positive or negative, we can’t disregard the core facts. These digital devices can and do pose potentially dangerous outcomes. Whether it results in serious injuries due to not paying attention to the roads or that comment on a post that hurt someone emotionally. There is a large scale of dangers as we increase our digital presence and disconnect with reality. </p>
                    
                    <p>In addition to disconnecting from the world around us, our brain pathways have also disconnected. Cognitive abilities face fundamental limitations as the mind is hypnotised more and more into a screen. Our cognitive system links to the processes of perception, memory, decision making, judgment, and emotional regulation. Tasks we perform countless times daily are colliding head first with these interferences. Neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley states the core of the dilemma and bases of the distracted mind, is the <blockquote>“conflict essentially between what you want to do and what you’re actually capable of doing”.</blockquote></p>
                    
                    <p>As technology moral panic gradually rises, alarming terms begin trending in the media. ‘Digital dementia’ and ‘Brain Drain’ relate to scatterbrains. Gazzaley, stated during the 2016 Commonwealth Club Conference ‘The Distracted Mind’, <strong>“most of us absorb three times more information every day compared with 50 years ago”</strong>. Our brains have excessive demands, resulting in continuous partial attention, and the consequences can include detrimental effects on our safety, education, workplace, and relationships. </p>
                    
                    <p>Cal Newport’s book ‘Deep Work’ addresses our inability to concentrate and constant interference due to the accessibility of technology. Described by Newport himself deep work refers to “professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit”. ‘Deep Work’ leads us to revisit habit-forming techniques. However, Newport aims to build healthy habits by steering away from digital technology. He addresses methods to engage our brain in meaningful activities. His rules to avoid distractions and immerse in deep work include:</p>
                    <h3>1. Deep Work</h3>
                    <p>We live in a world were distractions are impossible to escape from. We are always one click or tap away from distraction. If we jump between a task and emails or social media our brains experiences too much demanding activity leading to a lack of focus. Newport believes we need to forcefully quit these behaviours and maintain a deep work habit. He describes the process as “training your concentration ability and fighting back encroaching distractions”. He suggests adding routine and rituals to help transition into a state of unbroken concentration. </p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Embrace Boredom</h3>
                    <p>Boredom is one major factor we experience the pull towards digital devices. We don't enjoy the feeling of boredom. Newport believes embracing boredom and allowing your brain to rest will significantly improve your concentration abilities. He encourages regular meditation, exercising and repetitive tasks to not only relax but trigger ideas and solve issues away from your workstation and distractions. </p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Quit Social Media</h3>
                    <p>Newport expresses strong views to quit social media. He believes it is a source of unsavory entertainment, addictive and will permanently reduce your capacity of concentration. He expresses to his readers they will be better individual and professional if they distance themselves from social media. Whilst I don’t agree with eliminating all use of social media, as it provides us with huge beneficial connections, I do believe in managing our usage and removing it from situations when we require our brains to fully function. </p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Drain the Shallows</h3>
                    <p>Shallow work is technically the opposite of deep work. It is work that doesn't allow us to go deep. Unlike deep work, shallow work is “non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.” Newport doesn't suggest eliminating all shallow work as its a basic requirement for most jobs but believes we should minimise and contain it and focus on engaging in more lengthy beneficial tasks.</p>
                    <hr>
                    
                    <p>The problem is interferences have become acceptable or required. It’s acceptable for most workplaces to contact your outside working hours, a requirement to instantly respond to an email and it’s socially acceptable to glare at a screen while socialising. If we disrupt these acceptances and aim to tweak our habits by identifying a tech balance and engage in meaningful tasks, as Gazzaley stated you will <strong>“see value in a place you only felt anguish”</strong>.</p>
